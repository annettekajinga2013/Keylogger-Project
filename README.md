python keylogger.py
```
- Press **ESC** to stop logging.
- Keystrokes are saved in `keylog.txt`.

### 3. Automated Periodic Email Sending (New)
```bash
python send_keylog.py
```
- Sends keylog by email automatically every 10 minutes (adjustable).

### 4. Optional Clipboard Capture (New)
```bash
python clipboard_logger.py
```
- Captures clipboard text every 30 seconds and saves to `keylog.txt`.
